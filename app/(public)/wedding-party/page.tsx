He made the unfortunate mistake of mentioning he had seen some of this show I was interested in at the time. And so, in true socially awkward 6th grader fashion, all I did all day everyday was make references to the show and talk about the most recent episode I'd seen. I don't know what possessed him to decide I was friendship material after that but I'm so happy he did. Trenton is, to this day, the funniest man I know and always has me laughing until my stomach aches without even trying. He's seen me through all my phases of life and has been on the groomsman team longer than the groomsman team has been a thing.",
